Notes: BACS similarity experiment

	- in English? Would reach slightly different participant set as affix experiment, but they're separate so it doesn't matter? (also, don't want people to take this one before the affix experiment - but can launch it afterwards)
	- welcome message works online?
	- consent form suitable for online?

Chetail et al.
	- 1152 trials per participant
	- familiarisation w/ hand-copying -> given whole set to examine for 45s
